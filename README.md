# File Integrity Monitor

Lightweight File Integrity Monitor (FIM) — a small tool to track changes to files and detect tampering.

## About

This repository holds a minimal File Integrity Monitor. Use the included Python script (or add your own) to scan files, record checksums, and detect changes.

## Quick start

1. Install Python (3.8+ recommended).
2. Copy your `File Integrity Monitor.py` script into this repository (or create one).
3. Run:

```powershell
python "File Integrity Monitor.py"
```

Customize the script to specify which files or directories to monitor and where to store the state/checksums.
